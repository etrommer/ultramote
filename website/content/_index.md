Ultramote is a long-distance camera release system utilizing the LoRa radio protocol for remote triggering of cameras beyond the range of conventional wireless systems. It can achieve distance of up to several kilometers. Ultramote provides increased versatility for a variety of photography scenarios including wildlife, landscapes, and challenging environments.

# Hardware
## Interface
Ultramote has two 2.5mm jacks for input and output via two channels. Any regular remote shutter or time lapse controller can be connected and is relayed to the connected Ultramote device. For camera output, an adapter cable from a 2.5mm jack to the camera's remote port is required.

Ultramote can be connected to a PC via USB-C. Future firmware versions might include the option to control remote devices via a user interface from a PC/Laptop. However, this is currently a low priority.

Firmware updates can also be carried out via USB-C.
## Battery
A 400mAh LiPo battery allows for an idle time of several hours. The device can be charged via USB-C.
## Enclosure
Either a [60x42.5 aluminium extrusion enclosure](https://octopart.com/search?q=1455D602BK&currency=EUR) can be used, or the enclosure can be 3d-printed.
