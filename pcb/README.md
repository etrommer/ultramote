# Ultramote Hardware
Schematics, BoM, Gerber files etc. are generated using [KiBot](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot). To automatically generate documentation, install KiBot [as described here](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot#installation).

With kibot installed, change from the root to this directory and run KiBot:
```bash
cd <UltraMote Repo Dir>/pcb
kibot
```
This generates all documentation in the local subfolder `generated`. If you find that anything is missing, please open an issue.
